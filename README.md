## Overview
**DO IT** is a task management application designed specifically for software engineers. It addresses the challenges developers face in managing tasks like sprint planning, debugging, and tracking technical debt. Unlike generic to-do apps, DO IT seamlessly integrates with developer workflows and tools, providing features such as sprint tracking, GitHub integration, and custom notifications.

This project was built as part of our software engineering coursework at Virginia Tech, incorporating user feedback and modern design principles to create a scalable, maintainable solution.
